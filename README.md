# Roullette-Assessment
Determine the probability of bankruptcy if you were to open a roulette machine. Used in Garry's Mod Dark RP

I've found that one of the best ways to make money in some Garry's Mod Dark RP servers is to open a casino,
but what's worse than opening a casino and losing everything you own? Nothing but death, so this program was
developed to use a Monte-Carlo simulation to figure out your chances of going bankrupt at different price points.

Happy Grinding!
